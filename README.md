**Boundless BookRealm**

Boundless BookRealm is an e-Library management system that provides a comprehensive platform for users to explore, search, and access a vast collection of books. It is built using React (TypeScript) for the frontend, Spring Boot for the backend (with REST API), and MySQL for the database.

 
**Key Features**
* React (TypeScript) Frontend: The frontend provides an intuitive interface for users to explore books, search by title or author, and browse different categories. The homepage includes a carousel component to showcase featured books.
* Spring Boot Backend with REST API: The backend is built using Spring Boot and implements a RESTful architecture to facilitate communication between the frontend and backend. It handles book search functionality, pagination, and other operations.
* Book Checkout: Users can select books and initiate the checkout process to reserve them for a specific period.
* Book Review System: Users can write reviews, rate books, and view reviews submitted by other users, providing valuable insights for book selection.
* Authentication and Authorization: The application includes a secure authentication mechanism for user sign-in, sign-out, and account management. Certain features are restricted to authenticated users.
* Library Services: Additional services include saving books to a reading list, bookmarking favorite authors, and receiving personalized book recommendations.
* Admin Services: The system provides an admin portal for managing books, user accounts, and other essential aspects of the e-Library system.
